# jQuery

* What's the wilipedia definition of jQery.
* see a beginners tutorial on youtube/uacademy
* look for a good cheat sheet
* follow examples and test them 

I believe I should go through the 2 hours without any breaks, so I could really dive into
the material I will find.
Start wiht the more general and dive deeper and deeper to more specific information.
then try it out myself.
