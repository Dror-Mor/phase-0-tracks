# Web Servers

## What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
	* Files are waht builds everything. Hardware takes form in files as well.
	* A collection of small programs that do specific actions very well.
	* Storing data in text files.
	* Using codes that were previously written by others to craeate a whole new thing. 

## In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
* A virtual private server a software that imitates the preferences of a real server, without real server hardware.

* one primary advantage is the mere fact that you don't need to buy a phisycal server, , which may cost a lot of money. you can create many VPSs with cloud based evnironment or even locally on your computer. a second advantave of VPS is that it allows you experiment and try codes and operations you wouldn't dare to run on a real server. it's a virtual machine you can roll back (assuming you created proper branches). third advantage - you can modify the servers abilities as you go - if you need more memory or more processing strength for example.

## Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
Just like we wouldn't push our work directly to out master, we must create branches to protect our base code.
